## 🚀 Introduction
Multithreading is a core concept in Java that enables programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. This repository is designed to:
- Demonstrate how to create and manage threads.
- Explore synchronization and thread-safety mechanisms.
- Dive into advanced multithreading features like thread pools, ForkJoinPool, and CompletableFuture.

Whether you're a beginner or an advanced developer, this repository will help you master multithreading in Java.

---

## ✨ Features
- Well-structured examples for each multithreading concept.
- Unit tests to validate the implementation.
- Documentation for every topic with detailed explanations.
- Easy-to-run projects using Maven or Gradle.

---

## 🛠 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- Maven or Gradle (for dependency management)
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Java-Multithreading-Exploration.git
cd Java-Multithreading-Exploration
```

### Run Examples
Using Maven:
```bash
mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="<MainClassName>"
```
Using Gradle:
```bash
gradle run --args='<MainClassName>'
```
Replace `<MainClassName>` with the fully qualified name of the Java class you want to execute.
